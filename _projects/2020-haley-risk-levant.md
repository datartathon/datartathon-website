In 1927, a large magnitude Mw 6.3 earthquake originating on the Dead Sea Fault shook the Levant Region in the Middle East, leaving in its wake massive destruction and over 287 fatalities. We simulated an equivalent event occurring at the same location to understand the modern day impacts. 
Certain assumptions were made to arrive at these values associated with both the earthquake model and the consequence functions. All assumptions were based on literature (where present),country specific building code review, and engineering judgement.
