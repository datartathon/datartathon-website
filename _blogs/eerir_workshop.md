Sick of your default graphics settings, but donâ€™t know how to make your figures pop? Join us for this workshop on data visualization for earthquake engineers!

Over 1.5 hours, you'll learn how to build engaging and interpretable visualizations, no matter what software you use. The workshop will be accessible to visualization beginners, while also providing a useful review for intermediate and advanced visualizers.

No materials necessary to participate. The first half of the workshop will be devoted to a presentation on fundamental concepts to frame your visualizations. In the second half, you will get to practice with other participants these concepts using real earthquake engineering visualizations.
