# Communicating economic recovery with data stories

How can we track and communicate various facets of economic recovery after pandemic disasters like COVID-19? What can and can't data dashboards communicate? How can we write data-driven stories for various audiences? And while we are at it, how can we write good data stories? In this talk, Kshitiz covered processes behind coming up with various indicators of economic recovery after the pandemic and communicating emergent stories to a variety of audiences using media including data stories and a data dashboard for the CarolinaTracker project [https://carolinatracker.unc.edu/](https://carolinatracker.unc.edu/). He also shared his experiences teaching university students how to write data stories.
