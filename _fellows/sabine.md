Sabine Loos is a Mendenhall Fellow with the United States Geological Survey in collaboration with the Natural Hazards Center working on developing socially equitable earthquake risk products. Broadly, her research surrounds the development of disaster information that centers users and the human experience. She applies statistical learning, risk analysis, and user-centered design techniques to develop tools that inform effective and equitable disaster risk reduction, response, and recovery. Through the lens of data, her work bridges engineering with the natural and social sciences to prioritize the most vulnerable. She has worked across Nepal, Singapore, and New Zealand to gain firsthand experience of the impacts from disasters. The transdisciplinary nature of her work has led her to collaborate with Kathmandu Living Labs, the World Bank, NASA-JPL, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and others. She also co-chairs the Natural Hazards Center Researchers' Meetings and co-founded the Risk & Resilience DAT/Artathon. Sabine is a recipient of the John A. Blume Fellowship in Earthquake Engineering and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. She holds a PhD and masterâ€™s degree from Stanford University (2021, 2018), bachelor's degree from Ohio State University (2016), and will be joining the University of Michigan Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2023.
