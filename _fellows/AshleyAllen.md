Ashley is an Assistant Professor of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at SUNY Oneonta. She completed her Ph.D. in Geography and Anthropology at Louisiana State University (Geaux Tigers!) in 2020. Outside work, she likes spending time with her dog, Toby, and her cat, Wormy. She has many, many pictures to show you if asked. Ashley's current research focuses on the socio-cultural aspects of disasters, particularly disaster-based memory work and how communities communicate about disasters to adapt and mitigate risk.
