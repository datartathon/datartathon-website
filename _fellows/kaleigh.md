Kaleigh is a PhD candidate in civil engineering at Virginia Tech where her research focuses on improving earthquake-induced soil liquefaction hazard assessment for complex geologic settings. She is broadly interested in reducing the impact of natural hazards on vulnerable communities and will continue to pursue this goal as a faculty member at Penn State beginning in January 2023.
