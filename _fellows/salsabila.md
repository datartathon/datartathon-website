Salsa had finished her bachelor in Geodetic Engineering from Universitas Gadjah Mada. Salsa was born and raised in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, which is a home to Merapi volcano. This drives Salsa to study on impact assessment on volcano especially now she is focusing on multi-hazard and their interaction to different type of hazards.
