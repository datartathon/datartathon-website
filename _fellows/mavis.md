Mavis (they/them) is an environmental activist and Earth System Sciences PhD researcher at Stanford University (USA). Mavis' multicultural upbringing in the California Bay Area motivates their research interests in equitable flood mitigation and preparedness. In their current research, Mavis aspires to develop flood preparedness resources and infrastructure that re-empowers both local communities and wetland restoration. They are developing these solutions from multiple approaches, including impactful data visualization and community-based participatory research. Outside of their activism-based research, Mavis loves to read, hike, and crochet with family and friends.
