Hannah pursues interdisciplinary research in climate resilience at NYU Abu Dhabi. Presently, she examines drought impacts in Australia, sea level rise in the UAE and glacier melts in the Himalayas. During her undergraduate studies, she led a youth climate think tank and organised environmental education workshops. Passionate about climate policy, she has trained with Al Gore in climate leadership, participated in UN climate negotiations and provided policy recommendations for the G7 as a youth delegate.
